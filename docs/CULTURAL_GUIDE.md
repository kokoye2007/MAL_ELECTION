   - Avoid language that favors any political party or ideology
   - Use neutral color schemes that don't evoke political associations
   - Focus on institutional structures rather than political outcomes

2. **Institutional Respect**
   - Refer to official government institutions by their proper names
   - Use formal terminology for electoral processes
   - Acknowledge the complexity of Myanmar's political landscape
   - Avoid oversimplification of governance structures

3. **Historical Sensitivity**
   - Recognize Myanmar's complex political history
   - Avoid references to controversial political events
   - Focus on current constitutional framework
   - Present information in educational context

## Language and Translation Guidelines

### Myanmar Language (ဗမာစာ)

#### Official Terminology
- **ပြည်ထောင်စုလွှတ်တော်** - Union Parliament
- **ပြည်သူ့လွှတ်တော်** - Pyithu Hluttaw (House of Representatives)
- **အမျိုးသားလွှတ်တော်** - Amyotha Hluttaw (House of Nationalities)
- **တိုင်း/ပြည်နယ်လွှတ်တော်** - State/Regional Legislature
- **မဲဆန္ဒနယ်** - Constituency
- **ကိုယ်စားလှယ်** - Representative

#### Translation Best Practices

1. **Use Official Names**
   - Always use official Myanmar names as primary reference
   - Provide English translations in parentheses
   - Maintain consistency across all content

2. **Respectful Terminology**
   - Use formal register (စ စ်) for government institutions
   - Avoid colloquial or informal language
   - Include appropriate honorifics where culturally expected

3. **Accurate Transliteration**
   - Follow Myanmar Language Commission standards
   - Use consistent romanization system
   - Verify pronunciation with native speakers

### English Language Guidelines

1. **Terminology Consistency**
   - Use "Myanmar" (not "Burma") throughout
   - Refer to "constituencies" not "districts" for electoral divisions
   - Use "State" and "Region" as official administrative terms

2. **Cultural Sensitivity**
   - Avoid colonial-era terminology
   - Use contemporary Myanmar place names
   - Respect local naming conventions

## Typography and Visual Design

### Font Requirements

#### Myanmar Script (Unicode)
- **Primary**: Padauk (Google Fonts)
- **Alternative**: Pyidaungsu (Myanmar Unicode)
- **Fallback**: Myanmar Text (system font)

```css
font-family: 'Padauk', 'Pyidaungsu', 'Myanmar Text', sans-serif;
```

#### English Text
- **Primary**: Inter or Roboto for modern, neutral appearance
- **Alternative**: Open Sans for accessibility
- **Avoid**: Fonts with strong cultural associations

### Color Scheme Guidelines

#### Recommended Colors
- **Primary**: Navy blue (#1e3a8a) - institutional, trustworthy
- **Secondary**: Neutral gray (#6b7280) - professional
- **Accent**: Teal (#0d9488) - distinctive but neutral
- **Background**: Off-white (#f9fafb) - clean, accessible

#### Cultural Color Considerations
- **Myanmar Flag Colors**: Use sparingly and only for national context
  - Yellow (#fbbf24) - for highlighting national-level data
  - Green (#10b981) - for positive/neutral data points
  - Red (#ef4444) - avoid unless essential for data representation

#### Accessibility Requirements
- **Contrast Ratio**: Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text
- **Colorblind Support**: Ensure charts work without color dependence
- **Pattern Usage**: Use patterns/shapes in addition to color coding

### Layout and Navigation

#### Cultural Design Principles
1. **Hierarchical Information**
   - Present national data before regional/local
   - Maintain clear information hierarchy
   - Use consistent spacing and alignment

2. **Reading Patterns**
   - Support both left-to-right (English) and traditional reading patterns
   - Ensure intuitive navigation for Myanmar users
   - Test with native Myanmar speakers

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Optimize for mobile devices (primary internet access in Myanmar)
   - Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized
   - Test on devices commonly used in Myanmar

## Data Presentation Guidelines

### Statistical Visualization

1. **Context Provision**
   - Always explain what data represents
   - Provide historical context where appropriate
   - Include data source attribution

2. **Comparative Analysis**

   - Ensure geographic accuracy for all regions

### Interactive Elements
