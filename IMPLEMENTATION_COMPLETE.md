**Features Implemented:**
- 2020 vs 2025 election comparison
- Regional constituency change analysis  
- Historical map visualization
- Trend analysis and change detection
- Assembly evolution tracking

### ✅ **2. Map Rendering Optimization for 835+ Constituencies**
- **Performance Optimizer**: Created `src/map_optimizer.py` with intelligent rendering strategies
- **Adaptive Rendering**: Auto-selects optimal visualization based on data size

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation Details**

### Database Architecture
```sql
-- Core tables implemented:
├── constituencies (2025 data - 835 records)
├── historical_constituencies (2020 data - 280 records)  
├── assemblies (metadata for 4 assembly types)
├── cached_statistics (performance caching)
├── audit_log (change tracking)
└── mimu_boundaries (geographic boundaries)
```

### Application Stack
```
src/
├── app_enhanced.py          # Main multi-assembly application (OPTIMIZED)
├── app_historical.py        # Historical comparison application (NEW)
├── database.py              # Enhanced with historical queries (UPDATED)
├── map_optimizer.py         # Performance optimization engine (NEW)
└── visualizations.py        # Original visualization components
```

### Performance Optimization Features
```python
# Adaptive rendering based on data size
if data_size > 300: render_mode = "heatmap"
elif data_size > 100: render_mode = "cluster"  
elif data_size > 50: render_mode = "simplified"
else: render_mode = "full"

# Performance modes
- Fast: Optimized for speed (GeoJSON, reduced features)
- Balanced: Good compromise (smart clustering)
- Quality: Best visuals (full markers, detailed popups)
```

## 📈 **Historical Analysis Capabilities**

### Election Comparison Features
- **Constituency Changes**: Track regional redistribution
- **Assembly Evolution**: Single → Multi-assembly expansion
- **Representative Changes**: Electoral seat allocation analysis
- **Geographic Comparison**: Side-by-side map visualization
- **Trend Analysis**: Statistical change tracking

### Key Historical Insights
```
2020 Election → 2025 Election Transformation:
├── Constituencies: 280 → 835 (+555, +198% expansion)
├── Assemblies: 1 (PTHT only) → 4 (PTHT, AMTHT, TPHT, TPTYT)
├── Representatives: 280 → 835+ (massive expansion)
└── Electoral Systems: FPTP only → Mixed (FPTP + PR)
```

## 🔧 **Development Commands**

### Start Applications
```bash
# Enhanced multi-assembly app (optimized)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up myanmar-election-viz

# Historical comparison app
# Edit docker-compose.dev.yml command to: src/app_historical.py

# Test historical data
python database/historical_2020_migration.py
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Test with different assembly combinations
# PTHT only: ~330 constituencies → Full rendering
# All assemblies: ~835 constituencies → Heatmap rendering
# Mixed selections: Adaptive rendering
```
